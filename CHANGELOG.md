Please clear changelog after each release.
Thank you!
Put the changelog BELOW the dashes. ANYTHING ABOVE IS IGNORED

-----------------
- Increased the protocol version to 7.
- Reworked how Logs determine if they're edible by Termites so now only Trees will be edible, no longer Structures or other worldgen features.
  - Player-placed blocks are still protected. This just prevents scenarios like Villages being destroyed by Termites.
- Fixed Fireflies not rendering their base texture.
- Fixed Display Lanterns not properly rendering their contents when updated.
- Fixed some loot tables not working in 1.21+.
- Fixed Termite particles not rendering in 1.21+.
- Fixed a broken translation string in the `Entity` config.
- Fixed Cloud movement not working properly.
- Added the Reach Boost effect to Beacons, thanks to a suggestion by wet.noodle/Ashlyn.
  - Added the `Reach Boost Beacons` config to toggle this.
- Updated the Reach Boost icon, thanks to Zhen!
- Slightly increased the distance of the Reach Boost effect from 1 to 1.5 per level.
