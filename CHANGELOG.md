-----------------
- Removed the `breaks` section of Wilder Wild's fabric.mod.json as it was simply unnecessary.
- Disabled Lithium's raycast optimization, reinstating Mesoglea's liquid-like behavior on the client with Lithium.
- Fixed a crash while starting a server on versions that still support Indium.
