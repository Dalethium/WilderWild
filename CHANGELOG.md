Additions
---

- ### Added the Ostrich!
  - Ostriches are a feathery new mob with a passion for fighting.
  - Is tamed the same way as Horses, but takes a bit longer due to their feistier nature.
  - Instead of charging a jump while being ridden it will attack with its beak, the strength depending on how high the meter was charged.
    - If its beak hits a softer block while trying to attack, it may get stuck temporarily.
      - Added the `wilderwild:ostrich_beak_buryable` tag to control which blocks these are, currently containing the tags `minecraft:mineable/shovel,` `minecraft:mineable/hoe,` and `minecraft:wool.`
    - Added a new `Ostrich Peck Attack` config option to control whether or not players can use the Ostrich's attack while riding one.
  - Can be bred with Bushes.
    - Will lay an egg upon breeding.
      - Does not require Silk Touch to be obtained.
      - Requires a solid surface below in order to hatch.
  - Naturally spawns in the Savanna, Savanna Plateau, and Windswept Savanna biomes.
    - Added the `wilderwild:has_ostrich` biome tag to control which biomes they will spawn in.
    - Added the `Spawn Ostriches` config option to control whether or not Ostriches will spawn naturally.
  - If attacked and not tamed, it will chase after its attacker and peck them to death.
    - If they are tamed, this behavior will only apply to non-player mobs.
    - Will call other Ostriches for backup, like Wolves and Crabs.
    - While provoked, cannot be ridden or fed unless it's already tamed.
    - If tamed, can be fed or ridden while provoked to calm down.

- ### Added the Dying Forest!
  - New Fall-based grounds for all Fall enjoyers!
  - Contains Dying Trees, Dead Trees, Semi-Dead Trees, Fallen Trees, and few Living Trees.
  - The Grass and Foliage color is similar to that of Forests, but warmer and more mute.
  - All regular Forest Flowers grow here, though Seeding Dandelions generate more frequently.
  - Large Mushrooms generate just as they do in Forests here.
  - Bushes and Dead Bushes generate frequently throughout this biome.
  - Pumpkins will generate frequently here in comparison to other biomes.
  - Coarse Dirt Mounds, Coarse Dirt Paths, and Podzol Paths decorate the floor of this biome.

- ### Added the Snowy Dying Forest!
  - A mixture of death and snow. Perfect.
  - Contains only Dead Trees, Semi-Dead Trees, and Fallen Trees.
  - The only Flower found here is the Seeding Dandelion.
  - Dead Bushes generate frequently throughout this biome.
  - Coarse Dirt Mounds will occasionally generate in this biome.

- ### Added the Dying Mixed Forest!

  - All regular Mixed Forest Flowers grow here, though Seeding Dandelions generate more frequently.
  - Bushes and Dead Bushes generate frequently throughout this biome.
  - Pumpkins will generate frequently here in comparison to other biomes.
  - Coarse Dirt Mounds, Coarse Dirt Paths, and Podzol Paths decorate the floor of this biome.

- ### Added the Snowy Dying Mixed Forest!

  - The only Flower found here is the Seeding Dandelion.
  - Dead Bushes generate frequently throughout this biome.
  - Coarse Dirt Mounds will occasionally generate in this biome.

Bug Fixes & Changes
---

  - Updated the protocol version to 3.
  - Removed the Coated Sculk item model.
  - Added a new main menu panorama.
  - Added codecs to as many blocks as possible.
    - This has resulted in some blocks receiving reorganized and/or new constructor parameters.
  - Removed the `FloweringLilyPadBlock` class as it was redundant.
    - Please note that this will not impact the block itself in any way.
  - Added many public static fields to blocks for better code readability and editability.
  - Significantly improved the `OsseousSculkBlock` class and merged both growing methods into one.
  - Sculk Charges will now move to newly placed blocks in Osseous Sculk pillars upon growth.
  - Osseous Sculk no longer strictly requires a Hoe in order to drop, and now only looks for the Silk Touch enchantment.
    - This doesn't mean they'll only move in one direction, they'll just be snapped to that position initially as the block is set and can still move downwards afterward.
  - Echo Glass will now drop itself upon cracking if not hit by a Sonic Boom.
  - Stripped Logs can now once again be hollowed with an Axe.
  - Made the subtitle for hollowing a Log more consistent with the subtitle for stripping a Log.
  - Baobab Nuts and Palm Fronds are now compostable.
  - Changed the minimum and maximum amount of Milkweed Pods obtainable by shearing Milkweed to 1 and 3 respectively, previously being 2 and 5.
    - The Milkweed Pod to String recipe now requires 9 Milkweed Pods instead of just 1.
  - The Cattail to String recipe now only yields 1 String as opposed to 3.
    - This recipe now requires 4 Cattails instead of just 1.
  - Tweaked how Pollen chooses where to spawn particles, now being able to spawn particles above itself.
  - Fixed the placement of the seed particle created when a Seeding Dandelion random ticks.
  - Added the Bush, Tumbleweed, Tumbleweed Stem, Milkweed, Datura, Cattail, Flowering Lily Pad, Algae, Shelf Fungus, Small Sponge, Prickly Pear Cactus, and Nematocyst blocks to the `minecraft:sword_efficient` tag.
  - Potted Small Dripleaves now use their loot table (renamed `wilderwild:blocks/potted_small.dripleaf` to `wilderwild:blocks/potted_small_dripleaf.`)
  - Optimized how the Tumbleweed Stem's selects its outline/collision shape.
  - Reworked the `LiquidBlockRendererMixin` for making the underside of Water smooth to now be extremely reliable and much safer.
    - This also fixes an issue where other liquids like Lava could incorrectly be assigned different textures on occasion.
  - Removed the `Goat Horn Symphony` and `Back` discs as they didn't feel like necessary additions, nor did they fit Vanilla.
    - These will be datafixed into Lena Raine's `Otherside` and Samuel Ã…berg's `5` respectively.
  - Renamed the `Ancient Horn Projectile` to `Ancient Horn Vibration.`
  - Ancient Horn Vibrations will now spawn particles upon dissipating.
  - Ancient Horn Vibrations will no longer play the dissipation sound upon hitting an entity.
  - Fixed Floating Sculk Bubbles spawned from an Ancient Horn Vibration always being the same size each tick.
  - Changed the default size growth of the Ancient Horn Vibration from 0 to 0.01 per tick.
    - This is adjustable in the `Ancient Horn Size Multiplier` config, which used to be 0 by default.
    - You will likely need to manually edit this value if you've played with Wilder Wild before, as the config will likely have 0 saved from a previous version.
  - Made the visual scaling of Ancient Horn Vibrations much smoother.
  - Fixed the visual scaling of Ancient Horn Vibrations to match their bounding boxes.
  - Made Ancient Horn Fragments slightly rarer in Ancient City loot tables.
  - Defined the Random Sequence for every one of Wilder Wild's loot tables.

  - Optimized the file size of many Block and Item models.
  - Firework Rockets are now impacted by wind.
    - Added a `Firework Rocket Wind Intensity` config option to the `Misc` tab to control the percentage of how intense wind will act upon them.
    - Added `entity_firework_rocket` to the Mixins config to optionally force-disable this.
  - Reimplemented the custom Warden dying sound after it was accidentally removed during a bugfix.
  - The Warden's regular death sound will now play on top of its underwater dying sound once again.
  - Wardens are no longer considered alive during the custom death animation.
  - The Warden will no longer play heartbeat sounds while it is dying.
  - Prevented the Warden from moving while it is digging or emerging.
  - Changed the Warden's secret death sound from stereo to mono.
  - Refactored mobs' `canSpawn` methods to reflect Vanilla's, following the template `checkXSpawnRules.`
  - Crabs are now impacted by both the `Impaling` and `Bane of Arthropods` enchantments in 24w03a+.

  - Baby Jellyfish now always give Poison I with a duration of 4 seconds, while Adult Jellyfish now always give Poison I with a duration of 10 seconds.
    - This used to be a random range of time in previous versions.
  - The Jellyfish sting sound no longer plays at random pitches to be more consistent with Pufferfish.
  - Bubbles will spawn behind Jellyfish less frequently.
  - The Baby Jellyfish's movement speed is now determined with an attribute modifier instead of repeatedly setting the base attribute, making this attribute properly modifiable.
  - Jellyfish are no longer considered scary to Pufferfish.
  - Jellyfish stings no longer crash servers. ([#329](https://github.com/FrozenBlock/WilderWild/issues/329))
  - Changed the title of the advancement for capturing a Firefly from `Bottle of Lightning` to `Lightning in a Bottle.`
  - Fixed the `Restrict Instrument Sounds` config lang reading as `Restrict Instrument Sound.`
  - Significantly improved Wilder Wild's biome parameter modifications and cut down `OverworldBiomeBuilderMixin` in size in the process.
  - Moved all biome parameters, feature/spawn building, and most worldgen injects to individual biome classes.
    - This means `WilderSharedWorldgen` will only contain parameters for modified Vanilla biome placement from now on.
  - Expanded the depth at which Jellyfish Caves can generate.
  - Pumpkins now generate much more frequently in Old Growth Dark Forests.
  - Changed the `Cherry Grove Placement` config to be disabled by default as it wasn't as immersive as anticipated.

  - Added the Snowy Dying Forest, Snowy Dying Mixed Forest, and Snowy Old Growth Pine Taiga biomes to the `minecraft:spawns_white_rabbit` tag.
  - Added even more splashes, bringing the total of custom splashes to 271!
  - Removed all custom packets related to particles in favor of the regular Vanilla particle packet:
    - `WilderSeedParticlePacket`
    - `WilderControlledSeedParticlePacket`
      - This change has resulted in the `SeedParticleOptions` class receiving two new invocation methods and new constructor parameters.
    - `WilderTermiteParticlePacket`
    - `WilderFloatingSculkBubbleParticlePacket`
  - All custom `EntityDataSerializers` have been removed and replaced with regular String serializers in order to prevent possible issues. ([#333](https://github.com/FrozenBlock/WilderWild/issues/333))
  - Significantly cleaned up and reduced the amount of duplicated code in the `SimpleCopperPipesIntegration` class.
  - Much more refactoring, reorganization, cleanup and many small fixes!
